# Dinner Decider

A playful web app for two people who can't decide what to eat. Each person enters their preferences and the app suggests a meal that works for both.

## How It Works

1. **You** and **Jess** each pick your preferences (meal type, time, mood, effort, cuisine, budget, dietary needs)
2. Watch the **Alignment Meter** show how similar your choices are
3. Hit **DECIDE FOR US** to get a balanced recommendation
4. Don't like it? Hit **RE-ROLL** for another option

## Running

Open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step or server required.

## Tech

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Retro arcade UI with pixel fonts, neon glow, CRT scanlines, and glitch effects
- Lightweight scoring engine that balances both players' preferences
